  <h2 class="post-title">Misunderstandings</h2>
  <p class="post-date">2023-02-01</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    We all want to be understood, to have our thoughts, feelings, and experiences truly listened to without judgment, right? Feeling heard and validated is a basic need of ours. But why can it be so hard to even reach an understanding with our closest ones? Perhaps this is because communication is more than just exchanging words. It's about sharing emotions and perspectives, understanding each other's viewpoints, and having empathy for one another. Communication is a two-way process, and both sides need to be willing to understand each other.

What if the person we want to understand us doesn't? Of course, this can be frustrating and hurtful. But this is not a reflection of our value or the strength of our relationships. Sometimes, no matter how hard we try, we just won't be understood. That's just normal.
So, what can we do in such situations? Firstly, I suggest we pay attention to our self-care and self-love. We should accept that our thoughts and feelings are valid, even if others don't understand us. Encourage open and honest communication, and strive for understanding and being understood. We can even develop a deep sense of sincerity with people who don't have common ground with us, with time and effort.

Let's strive to create these areas of understanding, both with ourselves and in our relationships with others. If we want to be together, we need to keep the dialogue going and try to understand each other without giving up. Let's give each other the gift of being heard and valued, and let's create a world where we can all feel understood. Because this is a big need for us as a society and as individuals.

  <h2 class="post-title">The Tug of Life</h2>
  <p class="post-date">2023-01-24</p>
  <div class="post-content">
I would like to talk about the fast-paced nature of life and how it can wear us out, especially regarding the trivial matters that we worry about. There always seems to be something happening around us, things that need to be done, thoughts that never leave us alone. I thought this was a geographical issue, that I would be able to enjoy a carefree life like the people in Europe. Simple, trouble-free, carefree. However, I've come to realize that it's not that simple. It is quite difficult to break away from our habits. The differences in our thought processes are sometimes what I can't let go of, what make me who I am. I guess this is also part of my personality, something that has been taught and passed down to me. Today, I was particularly focused on my feelings of exhaustion, and I realized that I had forgotten my own birthday at some point in the day. This is a clear sign of my lost awareness, a result of my exhaustion.

But every time I manage to leave these feelings behind, to focus on the present moment, and to connect with the people around me, I am reminded of the importance of community and understanding. It's in these moments that we are faced with the true problems of humanity, and we realize the significance of being part of a society and coexisting with one another. One of the main reasons this feeling is lost is that you no longer need to think about it through an intermediary. Money. That's exactly why countries where money dominates have difficulties in achieving participation in society. People understand each other less and less.

Anyway, I may have written a jumbled mess. We reached our goal. This writing was a contribution to my mindfulness. Thank you for reading, stay with love.

  <h2 class="post-title">Meaningless Urgencies</h2>
  <p class="post-date">2022-11-15</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    I think patience is an essential ingredient to being a virtuous person. One needs to wait in every sense, both physically and mentally, for example, giving way to a pedestrian, waiting in line for bread or not cutting in line at the bus stop. Mentally, waiting to decide what to say or do is even more valuable, as it is easy to hurt those we love with our words or actions. Unfortunately, as a people, we are not virtuous because we don't know how to wait. We are impatient, hasty, and our blood boils easily. We want everything to happen immediately and we will do anything to make it happen. We don't want to leave anything unanswered and will respond immediately to any events. The point is, there is no meaning to the things we hurry for. What was it again, oh yes, we will make it on time. To where? To the bakery. How hard could that be?

  <h2 class="post-title">The Importance of Endings</h2>
  <p class="post-date">2022-11-04</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    It is said that an author spends a lot of effort on the first sentence, hoping that it would be very important and that, after reading the whole article, the sentence will be re-read and bring a moment of enlightenment.

That was what I wanted to be as a writer too. Because I always thought that firsts have a special place. However, as one grows older, one realizes that it is not the firsts that are important, but the endings. Because even if the firsts are forgotten, the endings are never forgotten. They come back as a wave of emotions every time they are remembered. They take along with them all thoughts and leave you alone with these overpowering feelings. Those strong emotions, memories, and final moments overwhelm you and you don't know what to do or understand why it happened. Your gaze is fixed, waiting for it to pass, but you know that one day, these emotions will catch up with you again, even if they have passed for now. Why? Because they are your emotions, they belong to you. That is why you have to make peace with those final moments and accept that the source of the disaster is with you. Only then does one realize that what is necessary to calm the disaster is to understand oneself and those endings.

That is exactly why the most important is not the first sentence, but the last one. Let's finish our first article with this final sentence. Think of that final moment, embrace it wholeheartedly, and forgive yourself when the end comes.
